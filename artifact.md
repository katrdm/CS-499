# Travlr Getaways – Full Stack MEAN Application

Travlr Getaways is a full-stack web application built using:

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Angular
- Node.js

The system allows users to browse travel destinations while administrators manage trip data through protected backend routes.

## Enhancement Overview

For this capstone, I enhanced the system across three core categories:

### 1. Software Design & Engineering

- Refactored backend for modular architecture
- Centralized error handling
- Converted asynchronous logic to async/await
- Secured configuration using environment variables
- Protected administrative routes with authentication

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures

- Implemented dynamic query filtering
- Added server-side pagination
- Introduced indexed search optimization
- Evaluated read/write tradeoffs for performance

### 3. Database Enhancement

- Implemented strict Mongoose schema validation
- Enforced required fields and type constraints
- Added role-based access control (RBAC)
- Prevented NoSQL injection through input validation

## Security Integration

Security was treated as a foundational design principle across all enhancements.  
Defensive programming techniques were implemented to reduce vulnerabilities and protect system resources.

This artifact demonstrates my ability to engineer secure, scalable, production-aware systems.
