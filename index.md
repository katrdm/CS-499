## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my academic journey, I developed strong full-stack engineering skills while cultivating a proactive cybersecurity mindset. My work emphasizes secure backend architecture, modular design, performance optimization, and database governance.

I approach system design by anticipating adversarial misuse, implementing validation controls, protecting sensitive resources, and evaluating algorithmic tradeoffs that impact performance and scalability.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

- Design maintainable and secure architectures
- Apply algorithmic reasoning to optimize systems
- Implement structured database validation and access control
- Communicate technical decisions clearly
- Deliver production-aware full-stack solutions
