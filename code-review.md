# Travlr Getaways – Full-Stack MEAN Application

Travlr Getaways is a full-stack web application developed using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. It allows public users to browse travel destinations while administrators manage trip data through protected routes.

For this capstone, I enhanced the system across three categories:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

---

## Software Design & Engineering Enhancement

Enhancements included:

- Modular backend refactoring
- Centralized error handling
- Async/await restructuring
- Environment-based configuration management
- Authentication-protected administrative routes

These changes improved maintainability, reduced attack surface exposure, and aligned the system with industry-grade development standards.

## Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement

Enhancements included:

- Dynamic query filtering
- Server-side pagination
- Indexed search optimization
- Reduced redundant data retrieval
- Evaluated read/write performance tradeoffs

These improvements increased scalability, improved efficiency, and reduced excessive data exposure.

## Database Enhancement

Enhancements included:

- Strict Mongoose schema validation
- Required fields and type enforcement
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure environment variable configuration
- Input sanitization and NoSQL injection prevention

These changes strengthened data integrity and demonstrated a security-first database design approach.

## Security Integration

Across all enhancements, security was treated as a foundational design principle. Defensive coding practices were implemented to anticipate misuse and reduce vulnerability exposure.

This artifact demonstrates my readiness for secure backend development and application security roles.
